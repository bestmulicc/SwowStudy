## In-action usage

``` yaml
      - name: Build Some extension
        uses: "./.github/workflows/winext" # if this thing is here or
        uses: "swow/some-action@somebranch" # if this re-released in separate repo (TODO)
        with:
          ext-path: .
          tools-path: whatever
          conf-args: --enable-yourext-debug
          ext-name: yourext
          deps: openssl,libcurl,libssh2,zlib,nghttp2
```

### "with" args

#### ext-path

Any path your extension source code (config.w32) located in.

For Swow, Swow's config.w32 is located in `<project dir>/ext`, so it will be `./ext` for Swow.

For Parallel (at this time), it's config.w32 is in root dir of project, so use `.` or keep it empty.

Default is '.'

#### tools-path

Directory for tools downloaded, default is `C:\tools\phpdev`

#### conf-args

configure.bat args, like `--enable-swow-curl`

Default is empty

#### ext-name

Necessary

Extension name for installing, like `swow`, needs match what is set in config.w32.

#### deps

Comma splited list for dependencies can be downloaded at `https://windows.php.net/downloads/php-sdk/deps/<sdk version>/<arch>/<depname>-<version>-<sdk version>-<arch>.zip`

deps will be downloaded into `<tools-path>\deps`, this dir can be cached for faster build.

Default is empty

#### install

If we install the built extension, '0' for not install, '1' for install.

Default is '1'

#### phpver

#### staging-deps

If we use 'staging' version deps, for master branch PHP extension build, '0' for not, '1' for using.

Default is '0'

#### fix-pickle
